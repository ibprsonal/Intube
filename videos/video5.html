            <p>In 2002 an anime version of Naruto began airing on television in Japan. It encompassed part one of the manga series and lasted until 2007. More than half of the 220 episodes followed the written story, while the other episodes involved new story lines. The show Naruto: Shippuden, which consisted of part two of the manga series, aired immediately after the first series ended. It lasted until 2017. The animated series dubbed in English began streaming in the United States in 2005. A sequel, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, debuted on Japanese television in 2017. It appeared in the United States with English subtitles in 2018. Several movies helped to further the story of the ninjas. Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow (2004) was released with English subtitles in North America in 2007 and Naruto Shippuden the Movie: The Lost Tower (2010) in 2013.</p>
